# trak

A new Flutter project.

Our app Trakz allows you to sign up, with an email or spotify, or sign in with your current account. 

The ticket master screen, concerts, calls for get API which it parses from static_values and pulls the information from the API to give events, specifically concerts, and displays the event name, date, and url to the ticket master page for the user to buy.
